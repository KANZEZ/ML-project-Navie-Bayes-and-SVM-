Naive_Bayes.ipynb:

0.important variable description
'kind'
'kind' = 0 or 230, related to different data preprocessing methods and different training and testing set from (bb and minist website)

1.reading data 
if you want to see results of bb data, change 'kind' to 230,
if you want to see results of minist web data, change 'kind' to 0
if you want to use your own data,if you want to use your own data, you are first recommened to use kind = 230(if performances are bad, than try with kind = 0), make sure every 'kind' is the same,and change .gz name according to 'kind' value

2.showing results
you can directly run all code in Naive_Bayes.ipynb, the results will show in pycharm and Naive_Bayes performance.txt



SVM.ipynb:

1.reading data 
if you want to see results of bb data, change 'kind' to 230,
if you want to see results of minist web data, change 'kind' to 0
if you want to use your own data, you are first recommened to use kind = 230(if performances are bad, than try with kind = 0), make sure every 'kind' is the same,and change .gz name according to 'kind' value

2.showing results
you are strongly not recommened to run the whole code, it will cost you long time to run(params setting part)
you can directly run other code block in SVM.ipynb,  the results will show in pycharm and SVM performance.txt
